# Code of Conduct

##This is a space where kindness, learning, and collaboration thrive.

## Be Awesome to Each Other ðŸ’«

Hereâ€™s how we can all contribute to a great community:
- **Be kind and respectful**: Treat others with empathy and understanding.
- **Celebrate differences**: Diverse perspectives and ideas make our community stronger.
- **Help each other grow**: Share knowledge, give constructive feedback, and support good ideas.

## Whatâ€™s Not Cool ðŸš«

Letâ€™s avoid:
- Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory comments
- Offensive jokes, inappropriate language, or personal attacks
- Sharing private information without consent

If youâ€™re unsure whether something is appropriate, err on the side of kindness.


## Enforcement ðŸš¦

If someone violates the Code of Conduct:
1. They may receive a friendly warning and guidance on better behavior.
2. Repeated violations could lead to temporary or permanent removal from the community.

## Letâ€™s Build Something Great Together! ðŸš€
